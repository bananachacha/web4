    <div class="left"><h3>Diary:</h3> I have been writing a diary since I was in high school. Buying a new diary at the end of each year is a little pleasure. Of course, I can't write it every single day, but I write a diary whenever I have some special days or something I want to remember.As time goes by and when I read the diary later, it's fun to read what happened in the past.</div><br><br>

    <div class="center"><h3>Memo:</h3> Usually, I like to take notes things when memorizing or organizing them, but after reading the book "The Use of Records(기록의 쓸모)," I'm doing the habit of taking notes more happily. While walking down the street or before going to bed, I don't let go of the little thoughts that came up in the unexpected. Who knows if one day I'll hit the jackpot with this little idea? :)</div>

    <div class="right"><h3>Review:</h3> I like to share good things with others and share opinions. I express myself with a variety of themes, including places I don't want to know alone, motivating words that make me a better person, and useful expressions in the American tv shows. It's a good opportunity to organize your thoughts and meet people who have similar tastes and tendencies.</div>

<h2>-Hobby colletor</h2>
    <p>I enjoy learning new things. When I add various experiences to my life one by one, it feels like I'm growing up. Especially, I like the experience of making visible results, and my new hobby this year is <strong>Oil pastel</strong>. I'm still at the level of copying other people's paintings, but I have a desire to create my own.<br>
    Occasionally when I find a favorite lyric or an impressive passage, I write it down in <strong>calligraphy</strong>.</p>

  <h2>-Curiosity </h2>
  I like learning new things. It's sometimes scary to challenge something you've never done before, but no one knows if it'll be fun or painful if you don't try it. I didn't know how to program at all, but I started studying html/csss by myself because I wanted to know how to modify landing pages. This allows me to handle the tags that make up the website. <strong>Isn't it wonderful that a small attempt to get to know something is driving another change?</strong>
